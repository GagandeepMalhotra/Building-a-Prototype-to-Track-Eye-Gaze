# Building a Prototype to Track Eye Gaze using Webcam

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains a prototype of an eye gaze tracking program that utilizes a normal webcam to estimate eye gaze in real-time. The primary objective of this project was to develop an inexpensive and accessible method for navigating devices, particularly for individuals with disabilities and motor impairments. The eye gaze tracker serves as an alternative input device, replacing the functionalities of a traditional mouse.

## How to Run

To run the eye gaze tracking program, simply execute the `TkinterGUI.py` file using the following command:

"python TkinterGUI.py"


## Features and Achievements

Over the course of 12 weeks, this project has successfully accomplished the following goals:

1. Real-time Eye Gaze Tracking: Developed a functioning eye gaze tracking system that estimates eye gaze using a standard webcam.
2. Replacement for Mouse: Implemented a use case that demonstrates how the eye gaze tracker can be used as an input device, effectively replacing the traditional mouse.
3. Accuracy and Robustness: Achieved a high level of accuracy in eye gaze estimation with minimal loss, even in challenging conditions such as obscured faces or non-ideal lighting.
4. Library Selection: Carefully evaluated and selected important Python libraries, including MediaPipe, OpenCV, Keras, and Tkinter, to support various functionalities, such as image processing and graphical user interface.
5. Machine Learning Advancements: Trained on a large existing database of eye images and their relevant look vectors (SynthesEyes 2015 Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge.), to effectively train a Regression CNN model, enabling accurate low-cost webcam eye gaze tracking.
